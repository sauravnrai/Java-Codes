We have base 2, 10, 8, 16, and build our own custom base too

We use by default base 10 or decimal number system


Base conversions:

We will convert base 10 to base 2 and from base 2 to base 8 or 16

We we are given a number in decimal, we will divide the number by 2 and store its remainder from right



Steps for conversion:

If we have a number in base 2 or 8 or 16 and if we want to find the decimal equivalent, then we will use 
the base, power, and digits from right. 

Starting point: The right most digit * base * power(0)

Ending point: The left most digit * base * power(number of digits - 1)

The power gets increase by 1 as we move from right to left
